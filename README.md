# PyBer_Analysis

Using Matplotlib, Python and Pandas to analyze and visualize Ride-sharing data with Jupyter NoteBooks.

## Project Purpose

The Main Purpose of this project to analyze two large set of Data: city_data, ride_data

1. From these two Data sets - Visualize into one Date set.

2. This Data set show-cases three categories Urban, Rural, Suburban city types.

3. Via these categories we got the total fares, avg fare/driver, avg fare/ride

4. Now using this retrieved information - We were able to get weekly fare values for Urban, Rural, Suburban categories

#### This in the end can help us improvize access to ride-sharing service and determining the affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Project Results

After Visulaizng the given data sets, we were able to asses:

1. The total number of drivers in Urban Areas are way higher than Suburban and Rural Areas.
2. Urban area has almost 5 times *Suburban* and 30 times *Rural* drivers

3. This results in more rides in *Urban Areas* in comparison to Rural and Suburban(about 13 times higher than rural and 3 times higher than Suburban)

4. The diffrence is also reflected in what rider has to pay in average - where Rural areas are paying more than Suburban and Urban

The Total Summary is:

With the above chat we understand that Urban areas ahve more drivers leading to more rides which in turn gives low average fare price for a rider as well as to the driver.
The Rural areas are in the bottom of the list with higher avergae fare price to a rider but it gives better average price to the rider in comaprison to Suburban and Urban.

#### Multiple-line Chart

Multiple-Line Plot conclusion:
This multiple-line charts showcases the total fare per city type changes by times. The X axis shows date from Jan-2019 to April 2019, and total fare in Y axis. In that line chart, Urban cities have highest total fares all the time, and Rural cities are lowest all over time. Suburban's line is in the middle.

Furthermore, the urban's line shows there are several peaks in March and April. At the same time, the line of rural shows some correlation to Urban's line. For example in the first week of March, urban's total fares are over 2,500 dollars. In parallel to that, rural's line reaches the lowest point, less than 360 dollars.


## Project Summary

Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

1. As per as the line graph reading - Introduce more drivers during the peak times of different month of the year and oberve if it increases the total fares
2. We observed fluctuation in the month of march for Urban areas, We need to explore the cause of the fluctuations
3. Consider the lows in Rural areas and detremine was causes the low - change the price charged by drivers then introduce more drivers ---see if total rides changes
